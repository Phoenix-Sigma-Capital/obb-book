# Bayesian Analysis with OpenBB and Backtrader in JupyterBook

This README provides an overview of integrating Bayesian analysis methods with OpenBB and Backtrader, demonstrated within a JupyterBook environment.

## Bayesian Formulas

We use Bayesian statistics for various analytical purposes. Below are some key Bayesian formulas:

1. **Bayes' Theorem**:
   $$
   P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \, P(A)}{P(B)}
   $$
   Where:
   - $P(A|B)$ is the probability of A given B.
   - $P(B|A)$ is the probability of B given A.
   - $P(A)$ and $P(B)$ are the probabilities of A and B independently.

2. **Posterior Distribution**:
   $$
   P(\theta|X) = \frac{P(X|\theta) \, P(\theta)}{P(X)}
   $$
   Where:
   - $\theta$ represents the parameters.
   - $X$ represents the data.
   - $P(\theta|X)$ is the posterior probability of the parameters given the data.
   - $P(X|\theta)$ is the likelihood of the data given the parameters.
   - $P(\theta)$ is the prior probability of the parameters.
   - $P(X)$ is the probability of the data.
